What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Besides understanding the overall Git workflow from beginning to end, I was unsure how often I should commit and push for every edit. I was afraid to do too much in case I had made a mistake earlier. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Merge conflicts became more clear, espcially since we made one ourselves before Release 5 in which case our guide told us to learn from our own conflict rather than the assigned one because it was actually more complicated and relatable to real-world conflicts. We had the same file being edited in two branches because we forgot to commit the files before switching branches. Turns out, the solution to correcting the conflict was ealier than I thought. When trying to merge, GitHub tells exactly what's preventing it so we went back into the file and re-edited to match the other branch so that we could finally merge both branches. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Smaller commands and codes that I haven't memorized yet like how clone and how to post an image in a file so that the full image appears when shown through markdown preview. 

What still confuses you about Git?

Mostly merging conflicts are what I'll be scratching my head about for a while longer until I've gone through enough. However, today really helped me understand them more but I'm still not at 100%.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was great to actually talk through what I'm doing out loud to others. By reiterating, I'm solidifying what I've learned so far. It's really helping it sink in faster than doing this by myself.
